# Javascript chalenges

this repo is a memoire of some of the javascript challenges i found interesting and most of the time taught me something i did not know in javascript.

From a simple syntaxe to a more complex logic, they may not be mysterious to you but for me they were at that time so i wanted to have them stock somewhere for future references.
